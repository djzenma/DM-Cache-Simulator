# Direct-Mapping-Cache-Memory-Simulator
Direct Mapping Cache Memory Simulator

In the main file, we have a couple of memory generators denoted from 1 to 6. 
Use them to simulate the direct mapping cache using the Cache.cacheSimDM() function.

The simulation works on any DRAM size, Cache Size and Cache Block Size the user wants.
